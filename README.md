#Learning Objectives
Understanding fundamental algorithms and data structures underlying the storage and manipulation of data by a relational database management system and select topics pertaining to non-traditional data models and applications, including document management, spatial data management, graph data management, and NoSQL (not-only SQL) systems.

##Topics:

SQL and relational algebra: brief review, equivalence, and compiling SQL into algebraic expressions
Recursive SQL and querying graph databases
Hardware/OS: virtual memory, storage, redundancy, the Buffer Manager
Query processing: in memory query execution, external memory query execution, iterators
Speeding up tuple retrieval: flat indexes, multilevel indexes, B+trees, hashing, multidimensional indexes
Transaction processing: ACID transactions, logging and error recovering, locking, timestamping, validation
RDF and SPARQL
Spatial indexes, simple spatial queries and nearest neighbor queries
NoSQL and Map-Reduce
